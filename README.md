Super Castlevania Editor Orginaly Developed by [RedGuyyyy](https://github.com/RedGuyyyy?tab=repositories) [RHDN_Forum Project Page](https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=21867.msg336111#msg336111)


The wiki here has a [manual](https://github.com/bogaa/SC4Ed/wiki/SC4Ed-stable-overview) to get you started with the editor!


The [MegaEDX](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/MegaEdX/tree/master) project was used to build Super Castlevania IV Editor on top off. The Megaman support was dropped but basic support for Gradius 3 and Contra 3 is added.


I try my best to improve the editor further.
