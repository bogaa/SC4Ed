You can find a release link and infos [Here](https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=24158.msg336115#msg336115)


RedGuyyyy used [MegaEDX](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/MegaEdX/tree/master) project to build Super Castlevania IV Editor. It has support for Gradius 3 and Contra 3 as well.


The releases here are for testing. This is my first project! I try to improve the project.
