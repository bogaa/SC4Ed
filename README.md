You can find a release link and infos [Here](https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=24158.msg336115#msg336115)


The [MegaEDX](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/MegaEdX/tree/master) project was used to build Super Castlevania IV Editor. It has support for Gradius 3 and Contra 3 as well. But the Megaman support was dropped.


I try my best to improve the editor further.
